No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days .\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\nHOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
